To terraform your machine:

On mac:

1. Download homebrew
2. brew install git tmux
2. In terminal preferences:
    - Change Profile to Homebrew (hit "Default", don't just select it) 
    - In the "Shell" tab, change "Run Command" to run `tmux`
    - In the "Shell" tab, change "When the shell exits" to "if exited cleanly"
3. Run 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:artoonie/dotfiles.git
mv dotfiles/{.*,*} . # hit 'n' to not override '..'
rmdir dotfiles
mkdir -p .vim/undo
```
